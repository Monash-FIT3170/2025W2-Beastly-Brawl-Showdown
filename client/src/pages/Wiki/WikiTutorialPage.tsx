You can do this by using your monster's set of abilities to hurt your opponent and protect yourself.\n• Using an attack on an enemy will make a dice roll. If the roll plus your Attack Bonus is equal to or higher than the enemy's Armor Class (AC), the attack will hit and deal 5 points of damage. If the roll is lower than the enemy's AC, the attack will miss and deal no damage.\n• Alternatively, you can use a defend to increase your AC by 5 for a turn, making it harder for your opponent to hit you.\n• In addition to attack and defend, each monster has 2 unique abilities with more advanced effects. Check the monster's ability descriptions for more information."
