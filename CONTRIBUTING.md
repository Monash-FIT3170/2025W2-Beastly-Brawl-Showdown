## 📝 Commits

### Commit Guidelines

Members should commit after any work is done. Use your own judgment to decide when to commit.

### Commit Message Format

The first line of the commit should follow this format:

```
branchID: message
```

**Example:**

```
1001: Add defender monster
```

### Extended Commit Messages

Commits can also include further comments about changes made:

```
1001: Add defender monster
- Created a defender monster that extends from Monster class
- Added special defensive ability
- Updated unit tests
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain **what** changed and **why**. This helps reviewers and future developers understand your work.

## 🌿 Branching Strategy

### Main Branch

> [!CAUTION]
>
> The `main` branch is **protected** and cannot be directly edited.

#### Key Rules

- ✅ All work must be performed in feature branches (or feature sub-branches)
- ✅ Merges to `main` require a Pull Request with 2 approvals
- ✅ Only shippable/deployable software should be in `main`
- ✅ Branch owner must manually squash and merge (this deletes the original branch)

### Feature Branches

#### Naming Convention

```
task/ID-featureName
```

| Component       | Description                                           | Example             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **task**        | Type of work (`feature`, `bugfix`, `docs`, `testing`) | `feature`           |
| **ID**          | Team digit (1st) + incremental number (next 3 digits) | `1003`              |
| **featureName** | Descriptive name with hyphens separating words        | `monster-selection` |

#### Team ID Prefixes

| Team       | First Digit | Example IDs         |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| Team Cobra | `1`         | 1000, 1001, 1002... |
| Team Rhino | `2`         | 2000, 2001, 2002... |
| Team Pogo  | `3`         | 3000, 3001, 3002... |

#### Complete Examples

```bash
feature/1003-monster-selection
bugfix/2015-health-calculation
docs/3007-api-documentation
testing/1012-combat-system-tests
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> The ID should increment by 1 for each new task that your Agile team works on, regardless of task type.

### Feature Sub-Branches

For complex features, teams can optionally divide work into multiple sub-branches.

#### Naming Convention

```
task/ID.N-featureName-subFeature
```

- Append `.N` to the ID (N starts at 1 and increments)
- Add a new description for the sub-feature

#### Examples

```bash
# Main feature branch
feature/1001-defender-monster

# Sub-branches
feature/1001.1-defender-monster-special
feature/1001.2-defender-monster-animations
feature/1001.3-defender-monster-tests
```

#### Branch Depth Rules

| Level                              | Allowed | Example                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Main → Feature**                 | ✅ Yes  | `main` → `feature/1001-defender-monster`                                             |
| **Main → Feature → Sub-feature**   | ✅ Yes  | `main` → `feature/1001-defender-monster` → `feature/1001.1-defender-monster-special` |
| **Main → Feature → Sub → Sub-sub** | ❌ No   | Maximum depth is 2 levels                                                            |

> [!WARNING]
>
> **Maximum branch depth is 2 levels.** You cannot create a sub-branch of a feature sub-branch.

#### Sub-Branch Merge Process

- ✅ Discuss with your Agile team before merging
- ✅ No pull request required for sub-branch → feature branch merges
- ✅ Delete the sub-branch after merging
- ❌ Do not merge sub-branches directly to `main`

## 🔀 Pull Requests

### PR Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **All changes** must go through a Pull Request. Direct commits to `main` are not allowed.

#### Mandatory Steps

1. ✅ Create PR with clear description
2. ✅ Share PR in `#pull-requests` Discord channel
3. ✅ Get **2 reviewer approvals**
4. ✅ **Squash and merge** to keep history clean
5. ✅ Use the auto-applied PR template

### PR Checklist

Before submitting your PR, ensure:

- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] All relevant tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated (if needed)
- [ ] No merge conflicts with `main`
- [ ] Clear description of changes
- [ ] Referenced related issues (e.g., "Closes #123")

### PR Review Process

    E --> C
    D -->|Yes| F[Squash & Merge]
    F --> G[Branch Auto-Deleted]
```

### PR Best Practices

> [!TIP]
>
> **Writing Good PR Descriptions**
>
> - Explain **what** changed and **why**
> - Include screenshots for UI changes
> - List any breaking changes
> - Reference related issues
> - Highlight areas needing special review attention

### Merge Strategy

**Always use "Squash and Merge":**

- ✅ Keeps `main` branch history clean
- ✅ Combines all feature commits into single commit
- ✅ Automatically deletes source branch
- ✅ Easier to revert if needed

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Do not use "Merge" or "Rebase and Merge" — only "Squash and Merge" is permitted.
