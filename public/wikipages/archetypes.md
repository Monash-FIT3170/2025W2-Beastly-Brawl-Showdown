Archetypes

Each monster falls under one of three classifications known as archetypes. A monster's archetype defines its playstyle as well as one of the moves it has access to.

Defender:
Defender monsters excel at outlasting their opponents in battle. They typically have higher AC and HP than other archetypes, and aim to whittle down their opponents with their superior durability.
Ability: Fortress Stance

Attacker:
Attacker monsters have formidible offences to take down their opponents quickly. They have the highest attack bonus of any archetype, and their moves specialise in dishing out damage in bursts.
Ability: Feral Strike

Balanced:
Balanced monsters are generalists, sporting playstyles that mix attack and defence. They have no major weaknesses, and are capable of mitigating randomness with their moves.
Ability: Tip The Scales
