How To Play

At the start of the game, each player chooses a monster.

Every turn, both you and your opponent choose a move.

Some moves deal damage, while others provide defence or other useful effects. Some moves are also passive and will apply effects without having to choose them.

Keep in mind that some moves can only be used a certain number of times in each battle. 

If your HP hit zero, you lose. Likewise, if your opponent's HP hits zero, you win!
